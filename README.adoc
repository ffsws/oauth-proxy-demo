= Demo Project for the `oauth-proxy` Sidecar Container

This project demonstrates how to use the https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy[`oauth-proxy`] sidecar container in an OpenShift cluster.

* Running instance at https://vshn-oauth-proxy-demo.appuioapp.ch/[APPUiO].
* Source code at https://git.vshn.net/education/vshn-oauth-proxy-demo[GitLab].

NOTE: This information comes from the effort required to deploy the https://vshn-oc-docs.appuioapp.ch/[OpenShift Documentation] website (https://git.vshn.net/education/openshift-documentation/[source code])

== Integration

In order to deploy the `oauth-proxy` correctly, pay attention to the following points:


=== ServiceAccount

Create a Dedicated `ServiceAccount` for the purposes of this container:

[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/sa.yaml[]
--
<1> Make sure the `reference/name` value in the JSON referenced by `metadata:annotations:serviceaccountsâ€¦` points to a valid route, defined in the deployment.

=== Deployment

Reference the newly created service account in the following locations:

. In the `Deployment`, at `spec:template:spec:serviceAccountName` key
+
[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/deployment.yaml[tag=service_name]
--
<1> The name of the service account created above.



. Also in the `Deployment`, in the arguments of the `oauth-proxy` itself:
+
[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/deployment.yaml[tag=args,indent=none]
--
<1> The port of the `oauth-proxy` container goes in the `-https-address` argument.
<2> The port of the container protected by the `oauth-proxy` container goes in the `-upstream` argument.
<3> Specify the service account name under the `-openshift-service-account` argument.

=== Route

[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/route.yaml[tag=reencrypt,indent=none]
--
<1> Use the same port name as the one defined in the `Service`.
<2> Use the `reencrypt` parameter here.
<3> And point to the corresponding `Service` as required.


=== ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

Create the required `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects, including all required rules:

CAUTION: You *must* use `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` *instead of* `Role` and `RoleBinding` for this system to work.

[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/role.yaml[]
--

=== Volumes

Specify the volumes and secrets containing the TLS certicate:

. In the `Deployment`:
+
[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/deployment.yaml[tags=volume_1,indent=no]
--
+
[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/deployment.yaml[tags=volume_2,indent=no]
--

. In the `Service`:
+
[source,yaml]
--
include::deployment/service.yaml[tags=tls,indent=no]
--
